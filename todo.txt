 TODO:
 - optimization, gridtracing only up to dMin
 – sphere-tracing based cube tracer, to show cuboid and spheroid voxels, and
   joined voxels
 - enable taking the surface color from another volume
 - how to deal with NaNs in volumes?
   treat like 0, or use them to create open surfaces?
   Section 2.3.4.1 of the OpenGL 4.5 compatibility spec:
   "Implementations are permitted, but not required, to support Infs and NaNs
   in their floating-point computations."
 – how to deal with inside positions? maybe indicate being inside by some
   sort of colored shade over the scene
 - do we want transparency?
