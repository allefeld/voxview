TODO:

- rounded voxels? sphere <-> cube

- optimization, gridtracing only up to dMin

- take the surface color from another volume

â€“ how to deal with inside positions? maybe indicate being inside by some
sort of colored shade over the scene

- do we want transparency? maybe only for one surface

- is thread-safing even necessary?

- zero-crop volumes

- why is it black inside of voxels?
