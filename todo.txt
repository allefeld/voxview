TODO:
 – sphere-tracing based cube tracer, to show cuboid and spheroid voxels, and
   joined voxels
 - optimization, gridtracing only up to dMin
 - take the surface color from another volume
 – how to deal with inside positions? maybe indicate being inside by some
   sort of colored shade over the scene
 - do we want transparency? maybe only for one surface
 - is thread-safing even necessary?
